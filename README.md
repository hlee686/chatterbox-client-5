#chatterbox-client
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com).

Chatterbox-client was an exercise in designing a client-side application that can interface with a Parse-powered backend in order to chat with other users. Core concepts covered: AJAX requests, Cross domain requests, and jQuery.
